# BookWyrm


![BookWyrm mockup image](assets/readme_files/mockup_img.png)


BookWyrm is a website created for avid readers to post and share information about their favourite books and authors. All under the protection of dragons.

The main objective of the site is to create a space where users can share the stories and authors they love with a wider community. This is achieved through the publishing of reviews and author bios.

### Scope

When reviewing the strategy table it is clear that not all features can be implemented in the first release of the project. In this case the project will be released in phases. The first phase will consist of features identified to build the minimul viable product.

**First Phase**

* Account registration

* Create, edit and delete Authors

* Create, edit and delete Reviews

* Save un-published content as a draft 

**Second Phase**

* Commenting on other users content

* Adding profile pictures for users

* Social Media registration

* Ability to search for reviews

**Future Phases**

*  Have a community rating system for book entries


### User Stories

GitHub projects was used as my project management tool to track user stories. Using the Kanban board helped me to better visualise the scope of the project and get tasks completed in an organised manner.

![User Stories Kanban img](assets/readme_files/user_story_kanban.png)


### Structure

The website has a Hierarchial Tree Structure so that navigation through the site is effortless. Here is a sketch of the structure made using [miro](https://miro.com/).

![BookWyrm website map](assets/readme_files/site_structure.png)

* The header, footer and nav bar remain consistent across all pages.

* Links and forms provide feedback to the Site User.

* Once the User us logged in or registered they are given greater access to the site.

* A custom 404 page has also been implemented.


#### Database Model

The databade model was designed using [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/). The type of database being used is a relational PostgreSQL database supplied by [Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/)

![BookWyrm database model](assets/readme_files/database_model.png)

The database model was designed before the project with a larger scope in mind. For this MVP release I will discuss the models that have been implemented. The others will be added at a later phase.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to help build the appearance of the site and display the placement of different elements in the pages. As the development of the project progressed some of the ideas in the wireframes were altered or abandoned so the wireframes differ from the final product.

### Surface

#### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme_files/color_scheme.png)

The colors used in the website are a dark red (#8B0000) for the main background and white smoke (#F5F5F5) for the header background and body text. Gold (FFD700) was used for subtitles and Davy's Grey (#4A4A4F) for the brand and alert text. Dark moss green (#4B5320) was used for the content boxes whereas golden gate bridge (#E84610), tangelo(#FF4500), brandeis blue (0D6EFD) , teal (188181) and verdigris (23BBBB) were used to style numerous buttons and links thoughout the site.

These colors were chosen because of their warmth and richness. They also match golds, greens and reds of dragons which suit the sites theme.

#### Typograpy

The main font used in the site is Roboto, with a sans-serif fall back in case of import errors. The font used on the brand and titles throughout the website is Kaushan Script with a serif fall back incase if import errors.

The Kaushan Script was chosen because it suited the theme of the site and Roboto is a script that reads well for content.
